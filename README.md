## Overview 
A Cinder application that allows you to write text and convert it to standard, digital text. It also provides the user with the option to send their converted output to a file of their choice.

## Dependencies

- [g++/gcc 4.8](https://gcc.gnu.org) and above
- [clang 3.4](https://clang.llvm.org) and above
- [cmake](https://cmake.org)
- [OpenCV 4.5.0](https://opencv.org/opencv-4-5-0/)
- [Tesseract 4.1.1](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)

### Ubuntu

```console
$ sudo apt-get install gcc cmake opencv tesseract
```

### MacOS

```console
$ brew install gcc cmake opencv tesseract
```
### Windows & Other Environments
Check out the links above for more info on how to install dependencies for your system.

## Code Style
This codebase was written in accordance with the Google C++ Style Guide (https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Demo
Below is a full demo of the application and its major features.

#### 4) Boost CLI Integration for Image to Text Conversion
By passing in appropriate image input paths and textfile output paths, a user can translate the text in an image of their choice to digital text.

## Citations
I began by modifying the code from of-snake (https://github.com/uiuc-sp18-cs126/of-snake-ElizWang), which was not written by me. However, I only used of-snake as a starting point and added enough code to completely distinguish my projecft from of-snake.

I used OpenCv's facial detection haar cascade in detecting faces from photos taken (https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml). This was cloned and added to bin/data/haar_cascades.

I also used ofxCenteredTrueTypeFont (https://github.com/armadillu/ofxCenteredTrueTypeFont) to format the game instructions. I cloned this and added it in src/header_addons. 

Below are the citations to the images I used. Note that all images (except for the user headshots) were taken from google.

## Additional Info
Here are some additional resources if you are looking to build upon this codebase or encounter any errors:

#### A Common Error
```console
Failed loading language 'eng'
Tesseract couldn't load any languages!
Could not initialize tesseract.
```
Please refer to [this](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/1309) Github Issue. You need to add [this](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/blob/master/eng.traineddata) training data file to your tesseract installation.
On Ubuntu, download and place this file at ```/usr/share/tesseract-ocr/4.1.1/tessdata/eng.traineddata```.
On MacOS, download and place this file at ```/usr/local/Cellar/tesseract/4.1.1/tessdata/eng.traineddata```.

#### Improving the Quality of the Tesseract Engine
Excerpt from Tesseract Docs:
> Tesseract does various image processing operations internally (using the Leptonica library) before doing the actual OCR. It generally does a very good job of this, but there will inevitably be cases where it isnâ€™t good enough, which can result in a significant reduction in accuracy.

Please look [here](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/ImproveQuality.html) for additional information.
